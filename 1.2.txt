The system consists of three client applications: a Web Application built with Next.js, a Mobile Application built with Expo (React Native), and an Admin Panel also built with Next.js. All three client applications communicate with the backend through a single API Gateway implemented using NestJS.

The API Gateway acts as the central access point for the system. It is responsible for handling authentication and authorization, routing requests, applying business logic, and coordinating data access. No client application communicates directly with the databases or infrastructure services.

After processing incoming requests, the API Gateway interacts with three core data services. PostgreSQL is used as the primary relational database and stores all persistent application data such as users, products, orders, and payments. Redis is used for in-memory operations including caching, session management, rate limiting, and background job queues. Elasticsearch is used to provide fast and flexible search capabilities, including full-text search and filtering over product data.

This architecture ensures a clear separation between client applications, business logic, and data storage while keeping the system scalable, maintainable, and secure.
