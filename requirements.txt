SOLUTION DESCRIPTION


1. SUMMARY OF SOLUTION

Within the scope of the project, a web- and mobile-application–based marketplace will be developed for diecast model car collectors. Collectors will be able to showcase their collectible vehicles on this marketplace, sell their vehicles, or trade them with others.

Currently, there is no such dedicated marketplace for collectors, and collectors try to sell their vehicles by sharing them on social media accounts or in relevant groups on messaging applications such as WhatsApp.

The membership-based marketplace to be developed will be the first marketplace dedicated exclusively to diecast model cars, and it will provide collectors with a secure environment that enables them to carry out buying, selling, and trading transactions.

2. DELIVERABLES

Marketplace (Web-based)
A web-based application compatible with desktop, tablet, and mobile phone browsers will be developed. This application will include the following features:
* Without registering, users will be able to view collectible vehicles in the marketplace, search, filter, sort, examine details of selected vehicles, add items to the cart, and complete purchases as a guest.
* By becoming a member of the marketplace:
o Users will be able to post vehicle listings and sell vehicles free of charge.
o With paid membership, users will be able to upload collections, sell and trade vehicles, use the system without advertisements, and feature their listings in the showcase.
* With paid memberships, users will be able to display their collections and share links to these collections on social media or messaging applications. Marketplace users can rate collections they like, and the most liked collections will be displayed in the marketplace showcase.
* Flexible membership and listing restrictions will be implemented, allowing the system to limit the number of free listings, enable paid listing options after a certain period, and manage these rules through the admin panel.
* The application will also include features such as adding comments to products or collections, messaging with listing owners, and rating products and listing owners. During messaging, phone numbers, email addresses, and inappropriate content will be filtered. During messaging, phone numbers, email addresses, and inappropriate content will be filtered. Enhanced filtering will detect contact information in various formats (including spaced formats like "0 5 3 5") to prevent sharing of phone numbers, WhatsApp details, and similar contact information.
* The application will be integrated with secure payment systems (PayTR and iyzico) and shipping companies (2 providers).
o Payments will be accepted in Turkish Lira.
o After payment, invoices will be sent to users automatically.
o Shipping fees will be calculated in real time, and tracking numbers will be generated.
