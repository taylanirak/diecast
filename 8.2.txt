Plain Text Explanation
The multi-server production deployment model is designed for scalability, high availability, and operational
resilience. Incoming traffic is routed through a dedicated load balancer, which distributes requests evenly
across multiple application nodes. Each application node runs identical service stacks, allowing stateless
components to scale horizontally and tolerate node failures without service disruption. Core data services
are isolated on a dedicated database node, ensuring consistent performance and simplified management
of stateful components such as PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. Object storage, backups, and log
archival are handled by a separate storage node, reducing load on critical database systems and
improving data durability. This architecture supports future growth, improved fault tolerance, and clear
separation of responsibilities, making it suitable for long-term production environments beyond the MVP
stage.
