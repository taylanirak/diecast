Plain Text Explanation
The admin module flow defines how administrative requests are authenticated, processed, and persisted
within the system. All admin interactions begin with a secured login process, enforced by an authentication
guard that validates roles, session state, and two-factor authentication requirements for privileged users.
Once authenticated, requests are routed to dedicated admin controllers responsible for dashboard
statistics, analytics, order management, user moderation, product approval, commission configuration,
and reporting. Controllers delegate business logic to the admin services layer, which aggregates data,
applies platform rules, and ensures every action is recorded for auditing purposes. The database layer
serves as the final interaction point, providing analytical reads and persisting audit logs. This structured
flow ensures secure access control, traceability of administrative actions, and maintainable separation of
concerns within the admin subsystem.
