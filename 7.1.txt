Plain Text Explanation
The admin dashboard is designed to provide administrators with a centralized and efficient overview of
platform activity. The layout prioritizes high-level metrics at the top, allowing administrators to quickly
assess sales performance, commission revenue, product activity, and user growth. Navigation is
organized through a persistent sidebar, enabling fast access to operational areas such as orders, users,
products, commissions, and reporting tools. Visual sales charts provide insight into recent trends, while
dedicated panels for recent orders and pending actions help administrators identify tasks that require
immediate attention. This layout supports operational efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and
scalable administration as the platform grows.
